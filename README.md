# AllDutchZipcodeFinder

Most recent release: https://github.com/LegeBeker/AllDutchZipcodeFinder/releases/tag/0.2.1

Find all dutch zipcodes between 4 digit numbers

This is a program I wrote in my free time to learn more about Python.

I am not giving a guarantee that all zipcodes are present.
I used this create a database of all possible zipcodes: https://github.com/jorritb/dutch-postal-codes
